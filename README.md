BlogMan is a new social blogging platform where anybody can share their views and read other's opinion related to any topic. It is a way to connect with people and to know how the world is thinking.

## Build Setup

BlogMan is created using the Mongo, Express, React and NodeJS (MERN) stack.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
